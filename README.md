# caesarShift
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.
# Files
# Caesar.py
This program is written in Python and its goal is to decrypt encrypted flags
# caesarshift.sh
This is a bash Script that will put our flags in a flags.txt file
# createflags.py
Python program that will use CaesarShift to change letters and numbers.
